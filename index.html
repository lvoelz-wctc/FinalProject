            <h2>Sounds For Dynamic States</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the home page for the synthesizer and electronic music project Valcove. I began Valcove in 2014, shortly
            after moving to Chicago and setting up my first studio in my apartment. Over the last six years I've released several
            albums, begun playing live, and expanded my studio into a dedicated space. While you're here, be sure to check out:

                    <div id="album_1_text" class="album_text"><p>I released the Eastward demo on April 06, 2015. It represents about two years of work, starting
                        around when I first moved to Chicago. At this stage I was obsessed with Monolake/Robert Henke,
                        and the music is a bit of an awkward attempt at copying his style without branching off into
                        finding my own voice. That said, I'm proud of this album for its status as a stepping stone
                        into my later musical output. A beat-driven version of "Redaction" sometimes makes its way
                        into my live sets these days, as the droning FM background pads are the one section of the demo
                        that I feel I really nailed.</p>

                    <h4 class="album_title">Forge</h4>
                    <div id="album_2_text" class="album_text">Forge is my first full-length album, released on the French netlabel Ultratech records on May
                        30, 2018. This album was the first time I was able to really latch onto a cohesive sound,
                        and had started experimenting with heavily-reverbed walls of sound based on slowly-changing
                        wavetables and FM pads - Arturia's Synclavier V and Live 10's new Wavetable synth are featured
                        very heavily here. My favorite track by far is "Chevron," which I wrote in less than a week after the
                        label asked for one my track to round the album out into a more industry-standard 8 tracks. The
                        majority of that track's instruments are Diva, which made creating it absolutely murder on my CPU
                        (more than a few near-crashes), but I love what I was finally able to coax out of it.</p></div>

                            <p>Mid-2018 through late 2020 was a fairly quiet year thanks to the one-two-punch of writer's block
                                and a cross-state move setting me behind in the writing process. By the end of 2019 I had finally
                                started jamming again, and found in my new home state of Wisconsin an opportunity to release a track
                                on a split of local techno producers. The Wired Explorations Volume 1 splilt features my track
                                "Supplicant," which I used to experiment with more aggressive and dance-floor focused sounds
                                while still maintaining an ambient backbone. I'd highly recommend this album to interested listeners
                                as the other producers on it contributed some excellent work.</p></div>

            <h2>Studio Slideshow</h2>
            <p>I started building my studio in 2013. Over the last seven years I've used each of my instruments
                to contribute to my albums.</p>

        <div class="image_class" id="image1">
            <p><img src="images/eurorack.jpg" height="378" width="504"/></p>
            <p>The E352 Cloud Terrarium is the main audio source of my eurorack setup. Its wavetable system
                is particularly good for light, plucky leads. I usually sequence it with either the Vector or MIDI
                from Live.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="image_class" id="image2">
            <p><img src="images/5u.jpg" height ="504" width="378"/></p>
            <p>I've been working on this 5U rig since 2017. I got most of my utility modules from
                Synthesizers.com to keep things cost-effective. The Club of the Knobs Fixed Filter Bank
                is amazing at tone-shaping, with a lot more subtlety than you'd get out of a standard
                lowpass filter.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="image_class" id="image3">
            <p><img src="images/p10.jpg" height="504" width="378"/></p>
            <p>I picked up this Prophet 10 almost immediately after I heard Sequential was rereleasing it.
                It's been the main source of pads for most of my ambient music lately. The "Vintage" knob
                for switching oscillator stability makes a surprisingly noticeable difference - setting it to "1"
                almost makes it sound like there's an LFO on the fine tuning.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="image_class" id="image4">
            <p><img src="images/sh2.jpg" height="378" width="504"/></p>
            <p>I found this SH-2 from a local seller who found it while cleaning out his friend's basement.
                While it's monophonic, the second oscillator puts it a cut above the SH-1 in terms of sound options.
                Some folks say its oscillators on their own are stronger than the Jupiter 8's.</p>
